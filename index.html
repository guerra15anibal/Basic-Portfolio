<h2>About Me</h2>

<hr>

<img src="#" alt="Me">

<p>My name is Anibal Guerra, just in case you didn't see the big title there. Your pronouce it ON_KNEE_BALL GER-RA most people have a hard time saying it.
    I'm 23, I really enjoy the outdoors when ever I have spare time anyways between work, school and also planning a wedding things can get pretty dificult. 
    I work in the automotive industry, just dealing with parts mostly, I also have an associates in applied science for automotive.
     This was always goint to be my backup plan, but life happened and 4 years later I'm finally starting to pursue what I have always wanted to do.
    Coding is something that has peaked my couosity, building something from nothing is just such an amzaing feeling. 
    I'm lucking to be able to have this oppertuty in my life. Other than building things from nothing I tend to be fishing, or camping mostly year round. Living in such a small town you ussally have more than one hobbie other than fishing and camping I enjoy building compurters,
    and also going to the range. Hobbies get pretty expensive, and fast.
