        <p>My name is Anibal Guerra, just in case you didn't see the big title there. You pronouce it ON_KNEE_BALL
            GER-RA most people have a hard time saying it. I'm 23 and I really enjoy the outdoors when ever I have spare
            time
            between work and school. I am also planning a wedding so things can get pretty difficult. I work in
            the
            automotive industry, just dealing with parts mostly. I also have an associates in applied science for
            automotive.</p>
        <p>This was
            always goint to be my backup plan, but life happened and 4 years later I'm finally starting to pursue what I
            have
            always wanted to do. Coding is something that has peaked my curosity. Building something from nothing is
            just
            such an amzaing feeling. I'm lucking to be able to have this opportunity in my life. Other then building
            things
            from
            nothing I like to go fishing, or camping mostly year round.</p>
        <p>Living in such a small town you usually
            have
            more then one hobby other then fishing and camping. I enjoy building computers and going to the shooting
            range.
            Hobbies
            get pretty expensive, and fast.</p>
