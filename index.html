    <p>My name is Anibal Guerra, just in case you didn't see the big title there. Your pronouce it ON_KNEE_BALL
        GER-RAmost people have a hard time saying it.I'm 23, I really enjoy the outdoors when ever I have spare time
        anyways between work, school and also planning awedding things can get pretty dificult.<br><br>I work in the automotive
        industry, just dealing with parts mostly, I also have an associates in applied sciencefor automotive.This was
        always goint to be my backup plan, but life happened and 4 years later I'm finally starting to pursuewhat I have
        always wanted to do. Coding is something that has peaked my couosity, building something from nothing is just
        such an amzaing feeling. I'm lucking to be able to have this oppertuty in my life. Other than building things from
        nothing I tend to befishing, or camping mostly year round.<br><br> Living in such a small town you ussally have more
        than one hobbie otherthan fishing and camping I enjoy building compurters,and also going to the range. Hobbies
        get pretty expensive, and fast.</p>
